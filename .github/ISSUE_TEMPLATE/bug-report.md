**Introduction**
It's great to know you're filing a bug report! But before you do so, search for existing issues to see if there are any that have been reported relating to what you're about to report. If you have, join the discussion over that issue instead and be sure you have something to add or subscribe to that issue to see any progress! Otherwise the issue being created will usually have to be closed and asked to join instead as to avoid clutters.

You should also provide a log if that's needed, but usually the only thing that matters from the log is mostly the stack trace. Sometimes the stack trace might lack the context needed to understand where the bug happens so providing what happened is usually better than nothing. 

**Mod Version**
Set the mod version in which this ended up happening in.

**Unintended Behavior**
Explain what you got when encountering with this bug.

**Intended Behavior**
Explain what you expected.

**Reproduction**
Make sure that steps can be replicated. Otherwise if that's not possible or have no idea how to reproduce it, do make sure to provide a log (usually a file will suffice). Here's one example:
1. Open the mod menu either through Mod Menu or by a key bind
2. Click on 'Cycle Menu'
3. Select any cycle that has its properties
4. See bug occur

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots unless if the bug occurred in the log.

**Additional Context**
Anything you might want to add that might not apply to the rest.
